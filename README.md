# DeBlocker.js

The front-end part of a nasty ad-blocker detection WordPress plugin that I encountered. Advertised as *Most effective way to detect ad blockers*. See the comment at the top of the script for more information.

It's reverse-engineered. Thankfully it doesn't contain complex logic, so the code is decently readable even with all variable names minified, and without comments.

See [my article](https://ibug.io/p/36) on how I worked around this script and proceeded with ad blocker enabled.
